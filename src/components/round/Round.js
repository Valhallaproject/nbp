            I always think that what I want to condense on a two-dimensional plane is the "power of being" of my subjects. In photography, we are always dealing with something that exists right in front of our eyes, but I call the overall power of the subject, such as mass, atmosphere, harmony, history, and cause and effect, the "power of being. I feel the power of the mere presence of a stone on the beach. At the same time, the concept that exists inside of me is also the subject of my photographs. To understand what one's own conceptual subject is is synonymous with a fundamental understanding of what the subject in front of one's eyes is. I want to go back and forth between existence and concept to look at the power of being.
